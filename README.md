## 🧼 Data Cleaning & Transformation

The raw dataset was cleaned using the following steps:

- Converted string-based numeric columns (e.g. `rating_count`, `actual_price`) into numeric types
- Created new calculated columns:
  - `potential_revenue` = `actual_price × rating_count`
  - `price_bucket` (categorized into <₹200, ₹200–₹500, >₹500)
  - `rating_review_score` = `rating + (rating_count ÷ 10,000)`
- Removed any anomalies or empty rows
- Handled missing values for price or rating

📌 The cleaned dataset is available in:  
**`Cleaned Data` sheet of `Amazon_CaseStudy_Complete.xlsx`**

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

All 14 analytical questions from the case study were answered using pivot tables and calculated fields.
